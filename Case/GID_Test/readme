Grid Independence Test for slice5 case by mesh refinement.

Every cell is subdivided into four quadrants
and the values of parameters in these quadrants
is set same as that of parent cell.

Flow is simulated for same time for both refined and unrefined mesh
and difference in parameters after simulation is analyzed between them
along the horizontal and vertical bisectors of slice mesh.
