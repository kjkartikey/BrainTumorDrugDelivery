The values of different parameters at each voxel has been defined in this 0 sub-directory.
The values of ktrans, por, and pvf were obtained from DCE-MRI data directly.
The categorisation of voxels in terms of normal tissue and brain tumor tissue was done by analysing ktrans data.
Then the values of other parameters for normal and brain tumor tissue were defined accordingly.
