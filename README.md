Numerical modeling of convection enhanced delivery (CED) in combination treatment (antiangiogenic and cytotoxic drugs) in heterogeneous vasculature of human brain tumors: An image (DCE-MRI) based CFD Analysis. The anticancer agents are directly infused into the lesion in this model which largely reduces the risks of adverse effects in chemotherapy and increases the drug concentration in tumor.

A 3D computational model of human brain tumor is developed using dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data into a voxelized porous media model. This model has been made taking into account realistic transport and perfusion kinetics parameters along with realistic heterogeneous tumor vasculature and hence it is patient specific. The flow is simulated in OpenFOAM The model is then used for analysing the effects of different tumor properties on the drug delivery, which can be used to maximize drug efficacy. Effect of antiangiogenic agents in combination with cytotoxic drugs is also studied which can be used for the selection of best combination of drugs for a specific patient.
