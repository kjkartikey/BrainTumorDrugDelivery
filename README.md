Numerical modeling of combination treatment (antiangiogenic and cytotoxic drugs) in heterogeneous vasculature of human brain tumors: An image (DCE-MRI) based CFD Analysis

A 3D computational model of human brain tumor is developed
using dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data
into a voxelized porous media model.
This model has been made taking into account realistic transport and perfusion kinetics parameters
along with realistic heterogeneous tumor vasculature and hence it is patient specific.
The model is then used for analysing the effects of different tumor properties on the drug delivery,
which can be used to maximize drug efficacy.
Effect of antiangiogenic agents in combination with cytotoxic drugs is also studied which can be used
for the selection of best combination of drugs for a specific patient.
